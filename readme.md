# Pigeon
Insert test build badge here. (Will be addressed in this task - https://trello.com/c/yptFCLY3)

## How it Works
Pigeon is a case management Slack app that allows volunteers to manage a text/chat hotline. Clients text a hotline number, Pigeon opens up a case and a conversation with the client via a chat channel.

Try it out by joining our [sandbox pigeon slack here](https://join.slack.com/t/ddf-hotline-sandbox/shared_invite/enQtNDM3ODQzNTY5Mzk1LTc5ZDA1MmI5N2E3MDdmMWJkZWQ2NDJiMTVmOWM3ZDBkYmI1OTBlZTJiMjRhYTg1ODg0ZDk2NjAwZjhmMTQxN2I). The hotline number you can text is pinned to the #general channel and is also in subject line of the slack.

### Tech
* Twilio > Smooch > Slack integration opening up a two way conversation between a client and a volunteer
  * Here's an [implementation guide for setting up those integrations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ_aW1YF75JLHjFQUJ_NHANT37NyNmeywmbNjeHH7ap1LTYL1dHA_vtYIVyRCmbygFf-okZzyvsjEAs/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
* Custom slackbot built off the [Botkit Starter Slack](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack)
  * Our custom Slack commands are in skills/slash_commands.js at the bottom of that file.

### For users
* Each text conversation opens up a new slack channel
* In Slack, a set of custom slash commands support case management functionality, including...
  * `/hello` - checks that Pigeon's properly installed
  * `/cases` - lists all the current cases
  * `/cases_pretty` - lists cases, but prettier
  * `/nextcase` - grabs the next unassigned case
  * `/assign` - assigns a case to a user
  * `/flag` - flags a case any label you write, "needs attention" is the default
  * `/unflag` - unflags a case
  * `/getflags` - returns a list of all flags
  * `/success` - closes a case
  * `/logout` - unassigns all cases for that user (ends their volunteer shift)

## How to Develop Locally

In order to develop locally without creating a Slack app from scratch, you'll need to request access for a few things:
* Access to jdp-hotline-test.slack.com
* Access to jdp-wilson-test app
* Ngrok account (for using a subdomain locally)
Please request access to these items by opening an issue and tagging @DDF-dev.

In order to develop locally, you'll need to run a local instance of the app and use ngrok to point a public URL to your local port. The jdp-hotline-test slack is set up to point to the ngrok generated URL. Below are steps to get started:

Clone the app and install dependencies with npm
```
git clone git@github.com:CyberSecurityFund/slack-hotline.git
cd slack-hotline
npm install
```

Copy the sample .env file into your own .env
```
cp .env.example .env`
```
Then, enter the client id, secret, and verificationToken from the (all from the Basic information in the test Slack).

Boot up the app!
```
npm run start
```

Now, we need to be able to hit our local app from Slack commands. This requires us to have a public url rather than localhost. Enter Ngrok.

To get set up with ngrok, follow the instructions in this tutorial.
https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok

Use the subdomain pigeon-testing when running ngrok to get the domain that the Slack app is configured to point to.
```
ngrok http -subdomain=pigeon-testing 3000
```
Note -- in order to have access to this domain, you will need to be added to our ngrok account. Please open an issue and tag @DDF-dev to request access :)

Your ngrok output should be something like...
![alt text](docs/screenshots/ngrok.png "Ngrok Screenshot")

Now go to the URL generated by ngrok. You should see an Add to Slack button. Click that button.

![alt text](docs/screenshots/auth.png "Auth Screenshot")

Click that button to authorize this app in the jdp-hotline-test app. You should get a success message like...

![alt text](docs/screenshots/success.png "Success Screenshot")

And your Slack #general channel should have a notification that you've just added that app as an integration.

Now try to call the `/hello` and `/cases` commands to ensure that all is well.

** Note -- if `/cases` is mysteriously erroring out, try deleting the contents of `/.data`. If you encounter this issue and are able to deterministly reproduce, please let us know (related to https://trello.com/c/ELdp5RGY)

## Staging App / Sandbox environment

* Pigeon app is deployed to https://staging-pigeon.herokuapp.com/
* Slack app is pigeon

## Slack App configuration
If you ever need to configure the Slack app side of things to update what URL the app points at, visit [Slack bot config](https://api.slack.com/apps) to update the URL in the following places...

* Oauth & Permissions > Redirect URLs section
  * Add the ngrok url PLUS "/oauth"
  * Click "Save URLs"
  * Then go to your ngrok url's homepage and click the 'connect to slack button'
  NOTE: this is for adding a TEAM to your bot -- slack doesn't actually need this step (at least in dev)

* Event Subscriptions > Enable Events
  * Update the Request URL
  * URL should be the ngrok base PLUS "slack/receive"
  * Save Changes!

* Slash commands
  * add the list of all the commands listed at the bottom of `./skills/slash_commands.js`
  * make the 'request url' your ngrok base url PLUS "/slack/receive"
  * CHECK the box 'escape users and channels in your app'
